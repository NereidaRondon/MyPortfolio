            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Education but the real world experience and skills I have accumulated in the last 11 years outweigh any degree or certification I could have earned. The transferable skills I bring to the table include: interpersonal skills, effective verbal and written communication, experience in leadership roles, project management, collaboration, researching, and solutions orientated thinking.</p> 
                
                <p>So far my hands-on approach has worked in building my skills in Semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I also have a grasp on responsive design with CSS Grid and building accessible applications.</p>
                
                <p>I aim to bring value to a team of developers as we enhance user experiences, design coherent UI, complete software testing, and diagnose development issues and their causes to create viable solutions.</p>

            <h2>How did I get here?</h2>    
		        <p> For most of my life, teaching was the end game. I was great at it, I loved the maths, and I enjoyed working with and shaping young adults. At some point, however, education was no longer my retirement plan because it offered no real professional growth, unless I left the classroom. I wanted a role that offered a different challenge but if I had to leave the classroom to do that then I saw no point in limmiting my options to the public education field.</p>

                <p>In my existential search for a new career path, I stumbled upon a new found ability in something I have always been interested in but never thought I would be good at... "coding". While building a portfolio website, for my now debunked plan of transitioning into Instructional Learning and Development (I mean it seemed like the logical path from teacher to L & D, right?), I discovered a passion for web development. I have always been intrigued by the idea of coding but I never saw myself venturing into that world until I unexpectedly walked through the door and felt at home.</p>

                <p>As I continued to work on my website, I discovered that this process that I was doing... researching, learning about web development, and then making it happen on my computer screen... was what I much rather be doing as a career. Unknowingly, I had been doing this process my entire teacher career but with different tools and it was one of the best parts of my job. Needless to say, I dived in and figured out that Frontend development is where I wanted to be.</p> 
                
		
			<h2>What interests me?</h2>
				<p>I am a married mother of two and we, along with our indifferent tabby cat Saber T. Tiger, live in sunny (and hot!) SW Florida. I like reading science fiction and have a guilty pleasure for anything super natural. On my free time, I learn more about coding and work on improving my JavaScript skills. I also enjoy the guilty pleasure of playing Call of Duty with my partner in crime, the husband. Other favorites are the Marvel cinematic universe and anything Star Wars.</p>
