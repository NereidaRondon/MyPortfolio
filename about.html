            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Education but the real world experience and skills I have accumulated in the last 11 years outweigh any degree or certification I could have earned. The transferable skills I bring to the table include: interpersonal skills, effective verbal and written communication, experience in leadership roles, project management, collaboration, researching, and solutions orientated thinking.</p> 
                
                <p>So far my hands-on approach has worked in building my skills in Semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I also have a grasp on responsive design with CSS Grid and building accessible applications.</p>
                
                <p>I aim to bring value to a team of developers as we enhance user experiences, design coherent UI, complete software testing, and diagnose development issues and their causes to create viable solutions.</p>

            <h2>How did I get here?</h2>    
		        <p> For most of my life, teaching was the end game. I was great at it, I loved the maths, and I enjoyed working with and shaping young adults. At some point, however, education was no longer my retirement plan because it offered no real professional growth, unless I left the classroom. I wanted a role that offered a different challenge but if I had to leave the classroom to do that then I saw no point in limmiting my options to the public education field.</p>

                <p>In my existential search for a new career path, I stumbled upon a new found ability in something I have always been interested in but never thought I would be good at... "coding". While building a portfolio website, for my now debunked plan of transitioning into Instructional Learning and Development (I mean it seemed like the logical path from teacher to L & D, right?), I discovered a passion for web development. I have always been intrigued by the idea of coding but I never saw myself venturing into that world until I unexpectedly walked through the door and felt at home.</p>

                <p>As I continued to work on my website, I discovered that this process that I was doing... researching, learning about web development, and then making it happen on my computer screen... was what I much rather be doing as a career. Unknowingly, I had been doing this process my entire teacher career but with different tools and it was one of the best parts of my job. Needless to say, I dived in and figured out that Frontend development is where I wanted to be.</p> 
                
		
			<h2>What interests me?</h2>
				<p>I am a married mother of two and we, along with our indifferent tabby cat Saber T. Tiger (or as I call him Sabey Wabey), live in sunny (and hot!) SW Florida. I like reading science fiction and have a guilty pleasure for anything super natural.  On my free time, I learn more about coding and work on improving my JavaScript skills. Also, my husband and I play Call of Duty (PC not console and I use a remote because I don't want to learn how to play with a keyboard) together. Other favorites are Marvel cinematic universe and Star Wars.</p>

            <h2 class="reason">Reasons you should hire me:</h2>
                <ul class="reason">
                    <li><strong>I've got 99 <s>Problems</s> Solutions...</strong> I'm a natural problem solver, always up for a challenge or finding ways to make a process more efficient. For example, as sponsor of Student Council, I changed the voting system from paper to electronic by using google sheets and google forms to vote. This streamlined the voting process, making it easier to tally votes without any paper and to keep the election process fair. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work...</strong> I am proficient in efficiently communicating and collaborating within a team as well as guiding new members and training inexperienced team members. I am an efficient communicator, but I am an even better listener.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy, I know her...</strong> I am a self-directed learner, a skilled problem solver and experienced in planning and staying organized. My mindset is to try to resolve issues on my own through research before asking for help because then I am more likley to learn from the experience. I am an expert in multitasking and working on a deadline with a strong attention to detail. If there is work to be done, I will do it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Integrity...</strong> I can proudly say that my work is done with a high level of honor and honesty. A quality I often try to model for my students and peers.</li>
