    <h1>About Me...</h1>
    <br>
        <h2>My Objective</h2>
        <p>I am an accomplished professional of 18+ years with great interpersonal and communication skills, developed early on in my previous experiences in customer service and perfected in my time as an educator. I revel in finding the root to ongoing challenges while making standard practices and processes more efficient.  I aim to bring value to a team of developers as we enhance user experiences, complete software testing, and diagnose development issues and their causes to create viable solutions. I have 10+ years of collaborating with peers, as well as guiding and training inexperienced team members. If anything is constant in the Education field, it is CHANGE, I have been successful learning new technologies by being receptive to change and being hands on, a transferable skill that will bring me success in frontend development.</p>  
                
           
        <h2>How did I get here?</h2>    
		<p>Lifelong learner, realist, and lover of creating, researching, and investigating. For most of my life, teaching was the end game. I'm great at it, I love the maths, and I enjoy working with and shaping young adults. Unfortunately, I outgrew the classroom and realized I had potential for more. 
        <p>In my existential search for a new career path, I stumbled upon a new found interest in coding while building a portfolio website for my (now debunked) plan of transitioning into Instructional Design Learning and Development. I wanted room to grow and moving up into Adult education seemed like an obvious career path for a teacher with tech skills and a general curiosity for technology. I started by learning about Agile, Adult Learning principles, and how to use Articulate StoryLine (which is just fancier Powerpoint). I was really enjoying learning and creating new things, so then I decided that I should have a portfolio to house my Storyline creations.</p> 
        <p>I researched how to create my own portfolio website, found an HTML5 template, researched how to convert Storyline presentations so I can host them or embed them on my portfolio website, and discovered that I much rather be doing that. While working on my portfolio, I learned a lot of HTML, some CSS, I learned about GitHub and creating repos, and all that jazz. I have always been intrigued by the idea of software development but I never thought that I could venture into that world. So, I readjusted my plan and decided that I should learn how to code. I figured out that Frontend development is where I want to be and started learning from every where and anywhere.</p>    
                
        <p>I am looking forward to continuing my journey into the tech industry through continuous learning and improvement. Acquiring knowledge as I go.</p>

    <h2>Reasons you should hire me:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I've got 99 <strike>Problems</strike> Solutions...</strong> I'm a natural problem solver, always up for a challenge or finding ways to make a process more efficient. For example, as sponsor of Student Council, I changed the voting system from paper to electronic by using the concatenate formula on Excel to create a unique password for each student. Students then used this password, which was their student ID number, to access a google form to vote. This streamlined the voting process, making it easier to tally votes and to keep the election process fair. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work...</strong> I am proficient in efficiently communicating and collaborating within a team as well as guiding new members and training inexperienced team members. I am an efficient communicator, but I am an even better listener.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Autonomy, I know her...</strong> I am a self-directed learner, a skilled problem solver and experienced in planning and staying organized. I am an expert in multitasking and working on a deadline with a strong attention to detail. If there is work to be done, I will do it.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Integrity...</strong> I can proudly say that my work is done with a high level of honor and honesty. A quality I often try to model for my students and peers.</li>
            <br>
            <li><Strong>Last but not least...</Strong> I am a great listener... I always admit when I'm wrong... and finally, I make people laugh.</p></li>
        </ul>
