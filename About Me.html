            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am a logical, seeker of knowledge, facilitator of learning, and coincidently a junior software developer. I hold a bachelor of science in mathematics education but the real world experience and skills I have accumulated in the last 11 years outways any degree or certification I could have earned. >If anything is constant in the education field, it is <strong>CHANGE</strong>, I have been successful in learning new technologies by being hands on and receptive to change, a transferable skill that will , no doubt, bring me success in the field of software development. The skills I bring to the table include: interpersonal skills, effective verbal and written communication, experience in leadership roles, and solutions orientated thinking.</p>
                
                <p>I revel in finding the root to ongoing challenges while making standard practices and processes more efficient. I aim to bring value to a team of developers as we enhance user experiences, complete software testing, and diagnose development issues and their causes to create viable solutions.</p>

            <h2>How did I get here?</h2>    
		        <p> For most of my life, teaching was the end game. I was great at it, I loved the maths, and I enjoyed working with and shaping young adults. At some point, however, education was no longer my retirement plan. With a raw potential and a desire for more, I started my career transition.</p>

                <p>In my existential search for a new career path, I stumbled upon a new found ability in an old interest... coding. While building a portfolio website, for my now debunked plan of transitioning into Instructional Design and Development, I discovered a passion for web development. I have always been intrigued by the idea of software development but I never saw myself venturing into that world until I unexpectedly walked through the door.</p>

                <p>As I continued to work on my website,I discovered that this process that I was doing... researching, learning about web development, and then making it happen on my computer screen... was what I much rather be doing as a career. Plans were readjusted. I figured out that Frontend development is where I want to be and started learning from every where and anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Reasons you should hire me:</h2>
                <ul class="reason">
                    <li><strong>I've got 99 <s>Problems</s> Solutions...</strong> I'm a natural problem solver, always up for a challenge or finding ways to make a process more efficient. For example, as sponsor of Student Council, I changed the voting system from paper to electronic by using the concatenate formula on Excel to create a unique password for each student. Students then used this password, which was their student ID number, to access a google form to vote. This streamlined the voting process, making it easier to tally votes and to keep the election process fair. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work...</strong> I am proficient in efficiently communicating and collaborating within a team as well as guiding new members and training inexperienced team members. I am an efficient communicator, but I am an even better listener.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy, I know her...</strong> I am a self-directed learner, a skilled problem solver and experienced in planning and staying organized. I am an expert in multitasking and working on a deadline with a strong attention to detail. If there is work to be done, I will do it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Integrity...</strong> I can proudly say that my work is done with a high level of honor and honesty. A quality I often try to model for my students and peers.</li>
