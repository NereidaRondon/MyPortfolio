            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am a logical realist, seeker of knowledge, facilitator of learning, and coincidently an junior software developer. 
                    
                I hold a bachelor of science in mathematics education but the real world experience and skills I have accumulated in the last 11 years outways any degree or certification I could have earned. The skills I bring to the table include: interpersonal skills, effective verbal and written communication, experienced leadership roles and responsibilities, 
                
                accomplished professional  I revel in finding the root to ongoing challenges while making standard practices and processes more efficient. I aim to bring value to a team of developers as we enhance user experiences, complete software testing, and diagnose development issues and their causes to create viable solutions. I have 10+ years of collaborating with peers, as well as guiding and training inexperienced team members. with great interpersonal and communication skills, developed early on in my previous experiences in customer service and perfected in my time as an educator.</p>
                <p>If anything is constant in the Education field, it is CHANGE, I have been successful learning new technologies by being receptive to change and being hands on, a transferable skill that will bring me success in frontend development.</p>  
                
                <p>I am looking forward to continuing my journey into the tech industry through continuous learning and improvement. Acquiring knowledge as I go.</p>

            <h2>How did I get here?</h2>    
		        <p> For most of my life, teaching was the end game. I was great at it, I loved the maths, and I enjoyed working with and shaping young adults. At some point, however, education was no longer my retirement plan. With a raw potential and a desire for more, I started my career transition.</p>

                <p>In my existential search for a new career path, I stumbled upon a new found ability in an old interest... coding. While building a portfolio website, for my now debunked plan of transitioning into Instructional Design and Development, I discovered a passion for web development. I have always been intrigued by the idea of software development but I never saw myself venturing into that world until I unexpectedly walked through the door.</p>

                <p>As I continued to work on my website,I discovered that this process that I was doing... researching, learning about web development, and then making it happen on my computer screen... was what I much rather be doing as a career. Plans were readjusted. I figured out that Frontend development is where I want to be and started learning from every where and anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Reasons you should hire me:</h2>
                <ul class="reason">
                    <li><strong>I've got 99 <s>Problems</s> Solutions...</strong> I'm a natural problem solver, always up for a challenge or finding ways to make a process more efficient. For example, as sponsor of Student Council, I changed the voting system from paper to electronic by using the concatenate formula on Excel to create a unique password for each student. Students then used this password, which was their student ID number, to access a google form to vote. This streamlined the voting process, making it easier to tally votes and to keep the election process fair. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work...</strong> I am proficient in efficiently communicating and collaborating within a team as well as guiding new members and training inexperienced team members. I am an efficient communicator, but I am an even better listener.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy, I know her...</strong> I am a self-directed learner, a skilled problem solver and experienced in planning and staying organized. I am an expert in multitasking and working on a deadline with a strong attention to detail. If there is work to be done, I will do it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Integrity...</strong> I can proudly say that my work is done with a high level of honor and honesty. A quality I often try to model for my students and peers.</li>
