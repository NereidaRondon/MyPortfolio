    <h1>Behaviorism</h1>

    <ul>

     <li>Provide an overview of behaviorism with dates, key researchers, and connections to teaching and learning.</li>

     The main influences of behaviourist psychology were Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), who investigated classical conditioning though often disagreeing with behaviourism or behaviourists; Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949), who introduced the concept of reinforcement and was the first to apply psychological principles to learning; John B. Watson (1878-1958), who rejected introspective methods and sought to restrict psychology to experimental methods; and B.F. Skinner (1904-1990), who conducted research on operant conditioning.


     <li>Share your opinion on the strengths and limitations of behaviorism in education (K 12 or Higher Education), corporate training, or another professional environment you are interested in. </li>


     <li>Discuss the implications of behaviorism for instructional (learning) design.</li>
     
    </ul> 

Behaviorism is deemed applicable to instructional design when you aim:

To create measurable and observable learning outcomes among students
To use tangible rewards and informative feedback to improve student learning performance
To guide students in mastering a set of predictable skills or behaviors
  
    <p class="fs-5">Behaviorism focuses upon observable behaviors, and behaviorists define learning as the acquisition of new behaviors. Although behaviorists acknowledge that the mind exists, it is relatively ignored in this theoretical approach because the interworking of the mind cannot be directly observed. Well-known behavioral theorists include: Skinner, Pavlov, and Bandura.</p>

     primary tenet of behaviourism is that psychology should concern itself with the observable behaviour of people and animals, not with unobservable events that take place in their minds.

    (Walinga, 2014, paras. 10) Impact On The Field Of Instructional Design
There is no doubt that learning in some instances results in the development of a physical skill; furthermore, the practicing of that skill will result in a response to a stimulus. The focus of behavioral learning theory resides in the use of reinforcement to drive behavior. Instructional Design can benefit from the use of reinforcement as a means to train learners to complete instructional objectives that are presented to them. The examples of teaching machines and programmed instruction are small contributions to the field but have paved the way Instructional Designers shape the learning environment to result in more effective strategies. It is important to note that many instructional strategies include the use of feedback to the learner as it assists in the development of positive behaviors that result from instruction.
